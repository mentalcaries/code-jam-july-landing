### 🧑🏽‍💻 FrontEnd

This project presents a clean and modern landing page coded in pure HTML and CSS, and features responsive behaviour down to mobile sizes. As per code jam rules, this had to be coded, checked and submitted in 24 hours. Nothing like a little pressure to keep things interesting.

It was also extremely fun to work with teammates based in different parts of the world, and in the end we were quite pleased with the result
